Question:
--------
Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Answer:
-------

1. Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript

2. Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.

3. An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.

4. The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object. You access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation.

    EX:  objectName.propertyName

5. Like all JavaScript variables, both the object name (which could be a normal variable) and property name are case sensitive. You can define a property by assigning it a value.

    var myCar = new Object();
myCar.make = 'Ford';
myCar.model = 'Mustang';
myCar.year = 1969;

myCar['make'] = 'Ford';
myCar['model'] = 'Mustang';
myCar['year'] = 1969;


6. Creating Objects In JavaScript :

    let bike = {name: 'SuperSport', maker:'Ducati', engine:'937cc'};
